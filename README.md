# 🧩 Pokémon Team Assignment

A web-based application built with **Next.js** that allows users to assign Pokémon to teams — potentially for battles, planning, or organizational purposes. The app is bootstrapped using [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app) and utilizes modern web development practices like TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and app routing.
